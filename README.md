# dataset_and_compromised_hosts
This repo will contain 100 datasetshat people on the internet can use to test their threat hunting and incident response analysis skills or their automated tools.  The datasets must be created from pen-testing a Windows Domain with Linux based systems and compromising the hosts.  The hosts can be compromised using known insecure applications within the past two years and activities of threat actors' behavior recreated to create datasets for analysis.  The datasets will be created by running a forensic collection toolkit and then posted online for public consumption and use.
