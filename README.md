# Imaging Rasomware Compromised Hosts
This repo will contain compromised host images people on the internet can use to test their threat hunting and incident response analysis skills or their automated tools.  The images will be created from emulating known ransomwares using Caldera on a Kali box against a Windows Domain. The images will be created and distributed to both classmates and for public consumption.
